					<Event interval={"2022"} title={"Accelerated My Learning"}>
						In 5 months, I learned how to build full-stack applications in
						Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track. Then, for the first
						time, I could use code to bring my visions to life.
					</Event>
					<Event interval={"2021"} title={"Always More to Learn"}>
						I used the university as a tool and learned the core computer
						science concepts the traditional way. I knew how to code but needed
						to gain the skills to program and apply code to real-world
						applications.
					</Event>
					<Event interval={"2018"} title={"Major in Computer Science"}>
						I started my coding journey with the traditional route of attending
						university. I learned C++ as my first language, which gave me an
